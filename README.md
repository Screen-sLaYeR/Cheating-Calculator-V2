# Cheating-Calculator-V2
I made a good cheating device  but this is actually a DIY electronics project built using an ESP32-S3 Super Mini inside a calculator body.

This project focuses on embedded systems, low-power design, and creative hardware hacking.

🔧 Features:

• ESP32-S3 Super Mini
• Hidden 128×32 OLED display (I²C)
• Calculator buttons interfaced using just 3 GPIOs
• Magnetic reed-switch power control
• Panic button for low-power mode
• Wi-Fi based text file upload via web interface
• 450mAh battery with 3+ hours backup

Files can be uploaded wirelessly by connecting to the calculator’s Wi-Fi and accessing its web server. Only text files are supported, and files can also be deleted directly from the browser.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is made strictly for educational and experimental purposes. It demonstrates electronics design and embedded programming concepts. Please do not misuse technology.
